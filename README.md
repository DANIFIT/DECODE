# DECODE
</p> Python code to allow a user to encode a piece of text using a cipher, or to decode the text using the same cipher. A “cipher” is a method of making a coded message that can be “deciphered”.</p>
In this code, the Substitution cipher is used, which is a very simple type of cipher that operates by replacing characters from one “alphabet” with the letters of another “alphabet”. In our case, we convert from English letters into the Al Bhed language from Final Fantasy X.
The encode and decode functions each have two parameters: the message, and a key value, where the key value represents how many times the substitution cipher will run. The key will have a default value of 1.
